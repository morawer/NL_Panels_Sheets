# NL_Panels_Sheets

NL_Panels_Sheets is a little program to automatize the creation of the sheets in the factory. 
The objective of this program is the creation of the panels orders sheets and the stickers we need to put in every panel created. This work in the last weeks was made of manual way, this caused the factory manager to spend a lot of time creating these posters one to one.

The creation of stickers was manual too beacuse the person in charge of this had to print the label the number of times it appeared in the 'qty' column manually.

I think this program improve this process because reduce the time for work and increases the quality of work since these processes are excessively laborious.

Thank you for your time and I hope you liked it. I appreciate the comments.
